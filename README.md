<p><strong>An elegant solution to power the old Soviet military radios that are using Ni-Fe batteries, usually in Common Ground configuration.</strong></p>
<p>They need +/- 2.4V with 2A on each power rail and are sensitive to over-voltage.</p>
<p>A linear regulator will get very hot and will have a low efficiency and this is why this SMPS was made.</p>
<p><strong>Some specs:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Frequency: 50 KHz (+/- 5%)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Tested input supply voltage: 7.5 to 17V.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Input recommended voltage: 10 to 17V.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Current draw when no load attached: 4mA</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Observed efficiency: better than 90%.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Output voltage (settable): +/- 1.4V to +/- 5V.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Max, Output current without radiator: 2x 2.5A&nbsp; for short periods, 2x 1.5A sustained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">-Max, Output current with radiator: 2x 3A&nbsp sustained </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I did some tests at 100 KHz and it is working well too and, by choosing the right capacitors, a +/- 12V can be achieved without any problems, making it a nice power supply for other old "green radios".</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Important thing is that those military radios can be powered from a large range of batteries, from RC LiIon packs to car battery!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">IGNORE THE TWO TL494 ON THE SCHEMATIC; THEY ARE THERE TO FACILITATE THE PCB DESIGN WITH THT OR SMD!</p>
